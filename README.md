<!-- Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project.

Team Builder is an application that lets you create an HTML file of your Development Team. The roles provided are a Team Manager, Team Interns and Team Engineers. This makes for a great addition to any group projects giving you a professional Team page with member names, roles and contact info. I learned who to implement my new understanding of classes and contructors to create a new and clean application.
